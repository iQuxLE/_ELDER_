# Enhanced vs Original Embedding Comparison Summary

## Overview

This analysis compares the original and enhanced HPO term embeddings by examining cases where cosine similarity and Resnik semantic similarity values diverge significantly. The results indicate that enhanced embeddings generally show improved alignment with Resnik semantic similarity, though the magnitude of improvements is modest.

## Key Findings

### Statistical Overview

- **High Resnik/Low Cosine pairs**:
  - 90.0% of overlapping pairs showed improved cosine similarity
  - Average improvement: +0.0361 (from ~0.179 to ~0.186)
  - Minimum cosine value increased substantially: from 0.086 to 0.127

- **Low Resnik/High Cosine pairs**:
  - 55.3% of overlapping pairs showed improved cosine similarity
  - Average improvement: +0.0055 (from ~0.823 to ~0.827)
  - Maximum cosine value increased: from 0.911 to 0.950

### Term Pair Changes

1. **Most improved High Resnik/Low Cosine pairs**:
   - "Hydrophobia - Jejunal adenocarcinoma": +0.0806
   - "Hydrophobia - Duodenal adenocarcinoma": +0.0782
   - These pairs showed semantically unrelated terms (low cosine) becoming more aligned

2. **Most improved Low Resnik/High Cosine pairs**:
   - "Abnormal muscle tissue enzyme activity or level - Abnormal enzyme activity in muscle tissue": +0.1026
   - "Elevated circulating alpha-fetoprotein concentration - Elevated maternal circulating alpha-fetoprotein concentration": +0.1002
   - These pairs showed already similar embeddings (high cosine) becoming even more aligned

3. **New pairs identified**:
   - Enhanced embeddings identified 6 new High Resnik/Low Cosine pairs
   - Enhanced embeddings identified 539 new Low Resnik/High Cosine pairs
   - This suggests the enhanced embeddings capture more nuanced relationships

## Pattern Analysis

1. **Hydrophobia Relations**: Many of the most improved High Resnik/Low Cosine pairs involve the term "Hydrophobia" paired with gastrointestinal-related terms. The enhanced embeddings capture these relationships better despite their semantic distance.

2. **Specific vs General Terms**: Many improved pairs show better alignment between specific and general versions of similar concepts (e.g., "Mesomelic short stature" and "Mesomelic arm shortening").

3. **Anatomical Specificity**: Enhanced embeddings better handle terms that differ only in anatomical location (e.g., "Preauricular pit" and "Auricular pit").

## Conclusion

The enhanced embeddings show modest overall improvements in aligning with Resnik semantic similarity, particularly for:

1. Semantically related terms that were previously distant in the embedding space (High Resnik/Low Cosine)
2. Terms with similar phrasing or that represent variations of the same concept

The improvements suggest that the enhanced embedding method better captures the semantic relationships defined in the HPO ontology, though the changes are incremental rather than transformative. The larger number of identified term pairs in the enhanced embeddings (particularly in the Low Resnik/High Cosine category) indicates greater sensitivity to detecting potentially problematic term relationships.

[//]: # (1. Focus improvements on terms where the largest discrepancies remain)

[//]: # (2. Investigate terms with declined similarity values to understand potential regressions)
